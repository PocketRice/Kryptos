			<td class="trTitle">EC-Council Certified Encryption Specialist (ECES)</td>
			<td>This certification comes with a program that introduces the field of cryptography and key algorithms such as DES, AES, and Feistel Networks. Those participating also will get hands-on experience in all sorts of ciphers and will learn steganography.</td> <!--https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/ec-council-certified-encryption-specialist-eces/-->
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="trTitle">CompTIA Security+</td>
			<td>This basic security certification encompasses a concise, in-depth foundation for any cybersecurity role. Security+ is continually updated to match the ever-changing cybersecurity scene, and is used by many companies to validate these skills. It is a great certification to have if you're considering cryptography as a career, or if you want to learn more security skills!</td> <!--https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security-->

		<tr>
			<td class="trTitle">edX Unlocking Information Security</td>
			<td>This online course by Tel Aviv University focuses on understanding how to combat vulnerabilities and introduces important cryptographic tools. While not a standalone certificate like CompTIA's catalogue, it provides a professional certificate. It is a great way to dive into the field of cryptography and the larger field of cybersecurity as a whole!
